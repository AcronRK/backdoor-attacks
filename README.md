# PyTorch Backdoor Attacks and Defenses in Image Classification

Welcome to the PyTorch Backdoor Attacks and Defenses repository! This repository contains the implementation of various backdoor attack models and defense mechanisms in image classification tasks using PyTorch framework. The focus of this project is to investigate the vulnerability of deep learning models to backdoor attacks and explore effective defense strategies to mitigate their impact.

## Overview

In this repository, you will find:

- Implementation of three prominent backdoor attack models: Badnets, SIG, and WaNET.
- Evaluation of these attack models on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- Implementation and evaluation of defense mechanisms to counter backdoor attacks.

Defenses not implemented yet
